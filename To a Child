Poem
Before mankind lived upon this earth
Adam was created without father or birth
Allah made him from different colored clay
so that is why our skins are colored in this way.

Some of us are dark and others a kind of white
but it is only our belief that separates us in His Sight.
He made us all to know one another
to become sisters and brothers each to the other.

But satan has worked hard to disrupt this perfect plan
by scheming, devising and then separating man.
So forget about the reflection in the mirror that you see
seek only the believing person you really want to be.

So forget about color and forget about pride
and let Prophet Muhammad* be our only guide,
guiding us to the Path that is so very straight
that strengthens us against satan, the wicked degenerate!
